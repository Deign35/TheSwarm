SwarmQueen = Entire Swarm Commands and evaluations.
HiveQueen = A Hive Cluster -- A group of rooms (how to group them?)

Objects will inform the HiveQueen of an available attachment point (spawn).
The HiveQueen will wait for a suitable creep to become available.
When a creep of that type is available, Grab the oldest (for now)
request in the queue.  Throw the creep at it, and let it run on its own.
Once mission is complete, it will either go back to a previous SwarmObject,
or it will be released to allow it to get a new SwarmObject.
