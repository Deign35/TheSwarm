Queen refactor including adding nests to HiveQueens.
Refactor the spawning system.  The spawn system should request from the consul,
    what the next spawn is and when it is needed by.
    This will make the spawning much simpler to handle.

HarvestImperator should be split between one that builds its container and one that doesnt.
    use this to double check that no construction site already exists right before plopping it down.

Change bootstrapping after refactoring spawning.  Use refactored spawning to setup the first group of 
    spawns for bootstrapping room #1.  Not needed for rooms #2+.  This should require a Nest queen that is bootstrapping
    when the spawn has been created, the containers, and the controller captured, release it to the SwarmQueen.

Get SwarmObjects implemented.  These can be like suits that a creep or a nest will wear.  The suit is essentially the imperator...
    In fact, these probably are for very similar roles.  Whats the diff once SwarmCreep splits to HarvesterCreep,
        DistributorCreep, etc...
