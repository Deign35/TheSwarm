Add a container to the controllerConsul/Imperator.
Add it as a delivery target to the distributionImperator

Change distributor to split hauling duty.  One source for spawnEnergy and one source for upgraderEnergy (primary purpose)

Have specific spawn filling logic that gets replaced from storage
all excess energy goes into storage.
towers filled by storage as well

Update distributors to pickup off the ground first.  Huge energy saver!!!!!

Add a template parameter to CreepConsulBase so I can:
export class SomeConsul extends CreepConsul<SomeConsul_CreepData>

Add to ConsulBase an abstract function for handling supplemental data.
