Have specific spawn filling logic that gets replaced from storage
all excess energy goes into storage.
towers filled by storage as well

Update distributors to pickup off the ground first.  Huge energy saver!!!!!

Make spawn room a nest queen until it is ready to be a HiveQueen
(when the controller gets to level 2, there is 1 container per source, a container at the controller, and a spawn.)




SwarmObjects should be loaded by their type as listed in memory.
Multiple SwarmObjects can reference the same GameObject
Memory will have a mapping for which SwarmObject is the active one.

In this way, a creep can be controlled by a SwarmContainer and a SwarmLink.
When Container is active, the creep is summoned to the container to retrieve energy.
When the link is active, the creep is summoned to the link to deposit.

Then each manager will load all their objects, run Activate on all of them, then the Object will check
which SwarmObject is active for a given object, and only OnActivate that one.


Have objects carry their SwarmObject ids in a Stack. 

Extension13: "I need a creep with carry"
CreepA: "Hi, I have carry parts"
Extension13: "Cool, let's check you out"
// Extension13 checks that the creep is suitable.
if(!suitable) {
    return "Go away"
}
Extension13: "I need 50 energy"
//CreepA checks if it has 50 energy

//CreepA has no money!
Extension13: "CreepA, I need you to go look for a job from a WithdrawTarget"
CreepA: "Alright..."
Extension13: "Here take this ID so that when you come back, you'll know where to go"

//CreepA goes back to the Queen.
CreepA: "Hey Queenie, I need a new job, something from a WithdrawTarget"?
SwarmQueen: "K, let me look, how much did you need? and how much can you carry?"
CreepA: "I need at least 50"
SwarmQueen: "How much can you carry and how fast are you?"
CreepA: "I can carry up to 500, and I'm Medium speed"
// Slow speed = 1 for every 3+ carry.
// Medium speed = 1 for every 2 carry.
// Fast speed = 1 for every 1 carry.
SwarmQueen: "To do what?"
CreepA: "Deliver to Extension13 in HiveClusterB"
SwarmQueen: "And how long do you have to live?"
CreepA: "800 ticks to go, almost middle aged lol"

// Asks the local hive queen about similar jobs nearby
SwarmQueen: "Hey QueenB, I have a request to deliver to Extension13."
HiveQueenB: "I see, well, I have some  other jobs in that area.  How much energy and time can I get?"
SwarmQueen: "You'll have access to 450 energy at a min speed of Medium."
HiveQueenB: "Alright, here...package these tasks up with it"
SwarmQueen: "You got it!  Now, where can my creep obtain the energy needed for this?"
HiveQueenB: "Lessee, ah, here, use this container.

//SwarmQueen goes back to creep
SwarmQueen: "Ok, here we go, I have a list of jobs for you to go accomplish, including your original"
CreepA: "No shit? Awesome!"
SwarmQueen: "Here's the list of deliverys for you to do, and here's your retrieval code, go back to your queen with it"
CreepA: "Thanks"

CreepA: "Hi QueenB, I have a code to retrieve 500 energy?"
HiveQueenB: "Yes, I've been expecting you.  Here, put on this SwarmObject."
CreepA: "Oh, ok.  Yep, got it"
HiveQueenB: "Now, before you get in, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of your current SwarmObject"
CreepA: "Ok"

// CreepA then puts on the SwarmObject for the creep located in the corresponding container.
ContainerC: "Hi CreepA"
CreepA: "What's that?  Who's there???"
ContainerC: "It is I, containerC.  Come seek me out"
CreepA: "Ok...I'm here, now what?"
ContainerC: "Take the energy you require from me and leave your SwarmObject at the door."

CreepA: "Hey QueenB, I'm done with that SwarmObject you gave me."
HiveQueenB: "Excellent, now...here is your list of deliveries, please proceed"

// CreepA then goes to each delivery target and asks how to get there, and then deposits upon arrival.
// Once the creep is finished with all deliveries, it starts again by looking for a new job.
