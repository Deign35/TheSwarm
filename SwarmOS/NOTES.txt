Have specific spawn filling logic that gets replaced from storage
all excess energy goes into storage.
towers filled by storage as well

Update distributors to pickup off the ground first.  Huge energy saver!!!!!

Make spawn room a nest queen until it is ready to be a HiveQueen
(when the controller gets to level 2, there is 1 container per source, a container at the controller, and a spawn.)
